Project 1:
AESV: Autonomous Environmental Service Vehicle
\SubBulletItem
Brief:
Cooperating with major network providers, tourist sights and multiply client companies, we are building the next-generation vehicle teleoperation platform.
With our partners providing island-wide 5G network and vehicles, our platform is able to teleoperate vehicles across the island, with low-latency image and 3D map transmission, even real-time force feedback.
We are exploring different application scenarios and vehicles for our teleoperation technology, and standardize our platform and its installation process on vehicle.
\SubBulletItem 
Project 2:
Distributed LiDAR: low-cost full-angle obstacle detection sensor module.
\SubBulletItem
Brief:
The most common way to achieve full-angle obstacle detection is to mount lidar or several depth cameras, which turn to be less cost-effective and require high computation resources.
This project is aimed at development of new sensor modules catering users' demand of cheap, light-weight and flexible solution to obstacle detection.
Several modules are already ready-to-ship.
One module with flexible design can adhere to desired surfaces.
One module with optical fibre conducting light, of which 32 fibres can be embedded in UAV propeller protectors.
This project has international patents in several countries.

\SubBulletItem
Brief:
We are exploring and pushing the limit of multi robot dense reconstruction and navigation system with higher performance on mapping and functionality of complicated exploration and searching task.
By integrating recent multi robot localization and optimization methods, and bringing in a new map compression algorithm, my paper proposes a new system able to build dense map with global consistency, robustness and work under less than 100 KB/s of bandwidth.
